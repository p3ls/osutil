## Testing

`go test ./...`

`sudo env PATH=$PATH go test -v ./...`

'sudo' command is necessary to copy the files '/etc/{passwd,group,shadow,gshadow}' to the temporary directory, where the tests are run.
Also, it uses 'sudo' to check the package manager, at installing and removing the package 'nano'.
